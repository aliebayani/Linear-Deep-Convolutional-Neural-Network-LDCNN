# Introduction
The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential and widely used instrument for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. It involves the recording of electrical signals produced by the heart using electrodes, which depict the activity of cardiac muscles during both contraction and relaxation phases. ECG plays a crucial role in detecting irregular cardiac activity, myocardial infarctions, and various other cardiac conditions.
